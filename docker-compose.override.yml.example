      # Time for which the health check can fail after the container is
      # started. This depends mostly on the performance of your database. On
      # the first start, when all tables need to be created the start_period
      # should be higher than on subsequent starts. For the first start after
      # major version upgrades of Peering Manager the start_period might also
      # need to be set higher.
